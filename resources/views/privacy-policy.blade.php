                    <li>We process information about you in order to provide our services in accordance with our Terms
                        of Service, for
                        example,
                        to allow you to join groups or to display your profile to other members; to allow us to send you
                        important service
                        updates; and to perform a contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>We also process information about you where it is in our legitimate interests to do so and not
                        overridden by your
                        rights (for example, in some cases for direct marketing, fraud prevention, network and
                        information systems security,
                        responding to your communications, the operation of networks of groups by the network
                        administrators, and improving
                        our

                    </li>
                    <li>Sometimes you provide us with sensitive information about you; for instance, the mere fact of
                        joining a certain group
                        may indicate information about your health, religion, political views, or sexual identity.
                        Joining such groups or
                        posting information on the Platform about these topics is entirely voluntary and, depending on
                        the settings of the
                        group
                        and your profile (e.g., public or private), our legal basis for processing any sensitive
                        information is either that
                        you
                        manifestly make it public or your explicit consent.
                    </li>
                    <li>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process information about you, or may
                        otherwise need the
                        information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, we may
                        process information, if
                        we
                        believe doing so is required by, or in accordance with, applicable law, regulation, legal
                        process, or audits.

                    by default, but can be hidden on our Platform. Some information, such as group memberships, will

                    recommend that you
                    check the group settings and what information will be available before joining the group to ensure
                    that you are happy
                    with the information that is visible to others. For more information, see this article on Account

                <p><strong>3.3 With Our Service Providers</strong></p>
                <p>We may use service providers in connection with operating and improving the Platform to assist with
                    certain business
                    purposes, such as payment processing, email transmission, conducting surveys or contests, data
                    hosting, managing our
                    ads, and some aspects of our technical and customer support. These service providers, which include
                    data analytics
                    providers (as discussed further in Section 3.5 below), may access, process, and store information

                <p>We may share information we have collected about you with others or allow others to use technologies
                    (like cookies, web
                    beacons, and device identifiers) that collect information about your use of the Platform and other

                <p>Depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your personal
                    information for purposes
                    of targeted advertising (targeting ads based on consumer activity across other sites and services).

                <p>We may access, preserve, and disclose information about you to government entities and other third
                    parties, including

                    are inconsistent
                    with our Terms of Service or related guidelines and policies, or if necessary to protect the rights,

                <p><strong>3.6 Social Sharing And Other Tools</strong></p>
                <p>The Platform may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions
                    that you take on
                    our Platform with third-party services, and vice versa. Such features let you share information with
                    your friends or the
                    public, depending on the settings you have chosen with the service. For more information, see this

                    the information will be governed by the third parties’ privacy policies, and we do not control the
                    third parties’ use of
                    the shared data. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing
                    in connection with

                    features.</p>
                <p><strong>3.7 Affiliate Sharing And Merger, Sale, Or Other Asset Transfers</strong></p>
                <p>If YOU is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of our
                    assets,
                    information about you may be shared, sold, or transferred as part of that transaction. We may also
                    share information
                    about you with current or future corporate parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.</p>
                <p><strong>3.8 Other Situations</strong></p>
                <p>We may de-identify or aggregate information about you and share it freely, so that you can no longer
                    be identified. Such
                    information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>We may also share information about you with your consent or at your direction or where we are
                    legally entitled to do
                    so. For example, your information may be shared with event sponsors and others as described to you
                    when you RSVP to an
                    event. Your information also is made available to other group members and event organizers when you
                    RSVP for and
                    participate in an event.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>We have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information.
                        We cannot guarantee
                        these controls will provide absolute security.

                <p>YOU is based in the North Macedonia. Information about you will be transferred to, and processed in,
                    the North
                    Macedonia and
                    countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection
                    laws that are
                    different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken
                    appropriate
                    safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, to require that your information will remain
                    protected in accordance
                    with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><strong>4.2 Security</strong></p>
                <p>We employ technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information that is under
                    our control and that
                    we process on your behalf from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
                    modification, or disposal,
                    both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we store all information that you
                    provide to us on servers
                    on which security controls are used. We train employees regarding our data privacy policies and
                    procedures, and
                    authorize employees to access personal information as required for their role. We use firewalls
                    designed to protect
                    against intruders and test for network vulnerabilities. However, no method of transmission over the
                    internet or method
                    of electronic storage is completely secure.</p>
                <p>Where you have a password, which enables you to use our services, you are responsible for keeping
                    this password complex,
                    secure, and confidential. If you would like to update or change your password, you may select the
                    “Forgot your
                    password?” link on the login page. You will be sent an email that allows you to reset your
                    password.</p>

                <p>We may temporarily de-activate your account if you have not logged in for six months or more. You may
                    contact us if you

                    <li>To comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will either delete
                    it or take steps to
                    de-identify or anonymize it in accordance with applicable law.</p>
                <p><strong>4.4 Policy Scope</strong></p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you have provided or made accessible to third
                    parties, such as
                    other members, including group organizers and network administrators, and others with whom you may
                    share information
                    about yourself. Our Platform may direct you to a third-party service, such as social media services,
                    or a portion of our
                    Platform may be controlled by a third party (typically through the use of a frame or pop-up window
                    separate from other
                    content on our Platform). Disclosure of information to these third parties is subject to the
                    relevant third party’s
                    privacy policy. We are not responsible for the third-party privacy policy or content, even if we

                    from our Platform or if we share information with these third parties.</p>
                <p>Members, including group organizers and network administrators, are directly responsible for
                    complying with all
                    requirements of applicable privacy laws in connection with the information that they obtain and
                    process for the purposes
                    of managing their contacts, organizing and communicating with groups, or administering networks.</p>
                <p><strong>4.5 Revisions To This Policy</strong></p>
                <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will provide notice to you by
                    publishing the most
                    current version and revising the date at the top of this page. Depending on the circumstances, we
                    may provide additional
                    notice to you of changes to this Privacy Policy, such as by sending you an email or by displaying a

                <p><strong>5.2 Your Choices: Location Information</strong></p>
                <p>When you first access the Platform, depending on your device settings, we will collect information
                    about your location,
                    which we use to make better recommendations for groups and events in your area, and to improve our
                    Platform. If you do
                    not want us to collect information about your location, then you can prevent this by taking the
                    following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If using a mobile app, by changing the settings on your device.</li>
                    <li>If using our website, your approximate location information will be obtained via a cookie.
                        Please refer to our Cookie
                    </li>
                    <li>Policy for additional information on how to manage our use of cookies.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Note that our Platform or its features may no longer function properly if you change your
                    settings.</p>
                <p>Your mobile device settings may also give you the option to choose whether to allow us to view your
                    geolocation on a
                    continuous basis, only when using the app, or never. Allowing us to view your geolocation when you
                    are not using the app
                    allows us to provide you with recommendations on a regular basis. Please refer to your device’s
                    guide for additional
                    information on how to adjust location services.</p>
                <p><strong>5.3 Your Choices: Cookies</strong></p>
                <p>We may use and allow others to use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other technologies
                    to collect
                    information about your use of the Platform and other websites and online services. See our Cookie
                    Policy for details
                    about these technologies and the information that they collect, use, or share, including how you may
                    be able to control
                    or disable these services.</p>
                <p>As stated above in Section 3.4, depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt out of the
                    sharing or
                    processing of your personal information for purposes of targeted advertising (targeting ads based on
                    consumer activity
                    across other sites and services), and you may be able to use your Cookie Settings to select cookies
                    you would like to
                    opt opt-out of, including those used for targeted advertising purposes.</p>
                <p><strong>5.4 Your Choices: Promotional Communications</strong></p>
                <p>You can control some of the messages that you receive from YOU and other members by selecting the
                    unsubscribe link in
                    the message that you receive, or by adjusting the communication preferences in your account
                    settings. We will also send
                    you a link to these settings when you first sign up and in subsequent messages. If you opt out, we
                    may still send you
                    non-promotional messages, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. In
                    addition, please
                    consult the privacy policies of other members for information about how to control or opt out of
                    promotional messages
                    from them off the Platform.</p>
                <p><strong>5.5 Your Choices: Photo Tagging</strong></p>
                <p>You can tag photos of yourself and others. When a photo has been tagged it means that the name of
                    that person will
                    appear alongside the photo, and the tagged photo will appear on the tagged member’s group
                    profile.</p>
                <p>We will notify you when another member has tagged your account in a photo or when additional comments
                    are added to such
                    photos. You can remove tags by selecting the “untag” option next to your name. You can also report
                    inappropriate content
                    to YOU. You are responsible for obtaining permission from non-members to post a photo of them on the
                    Platform.</p>
